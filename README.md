# Statistics for Data Science

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key **Statistics** concepts applied to **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. The focus is on **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**, **Probability Distributions**, **Hypothesis Testing**, and **Regression Analysis**, with practical implementations in Python using ```NumPy```, ```Pandas```, and ```Scipy```.

## 📂 Contents

📘 **Jupyter Notebooks:** Hands-on examples and explanations of core statistical concepts.

📊 **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and distributions.

🎲 **Probability Distributions:** Normal, binomial, Poisson, exponential, and uniform distributions.

🧪 **Hypothesis Testing:** t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, and z-tests.

📈 **Regression & Correlation:** Linear regression, multiple regression, and correlation analysis.

🛠️ **Python Libraries:** ```NumPy```, ```Pandas```, ```Matplotlib```, ```Seaborn```, ```Scipy```, ```Scikit-learn```.
